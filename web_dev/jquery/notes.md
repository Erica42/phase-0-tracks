how to learn as much as I can in 2 hours:
get jQuery cheatsheet,
see if there are any docs on jQuery
look at the actual library
google "learn jQuery"
google "jQuery important"
google "jQuery youtube"
google "most common jQuery" and follow the rabbit hole
find something to test the jQuery in
break after every 30 minutes for 5 minutes


$(document).ready(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});
This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.
All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().
