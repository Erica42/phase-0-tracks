how to learn as much as I can in 2 hours:
get jQuery cheatsheet,
see if there are any docs on jQuery
look at the actual library
google "learn jQuery"
google "jQuery important"
google "jQuery youtube"
google "most common jQuery" and follow the rabbit hole
find something to test the jQuery in
break after every 30 minutes for 5 minutes

Going through the http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp and answering the test questions has been really helpful.
