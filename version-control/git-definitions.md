# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is something that allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files. It also allows us to merge revisions made by different people. It is project management where there is a save point for each new iteration of the project. Version control is useful in that your master code is always clean, you can walk the project back to a previous version if you need, and multiple people can work on the same project at once.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch starts as a copy of the master that you can checkout and make changes to. You would use it to add a new feature without messing with the master so that you can do testing and make sure it works before adding it back into the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point. A good commit message describes the specific change that is being added.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two (or more) people have worked on the same file at the same time. It is a fairly common occurrence that can often be resolved in the command line, but sometimes will need to be fixed in a text editor.
