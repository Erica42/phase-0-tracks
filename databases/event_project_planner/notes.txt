if I was going to expand the program I’d start with:
puts "Would you like a list of projects by date to 'start', or date they are 'due'?"
if gets.chomp == 'start'
  … finish stuff here.

date = Date.parse(due)

#display by start date




# Enter type of event
# Enter type of project for the event
# Enter due date of project
# Enter date of event
# User pull up the application and it checks the date now
# Pulls up by month
# What is over due ? (optional/unlikely)
# What to do
# What has been done
# What events are happening

#Compute the current date.
#SELECT date('now');
# my_time = Time.new(some_sql_retrieval_of_a_time)
# my_time.strftime("at %I:%M%p")
#driver code
# ask for name, type, date of event
  # convert into exacutiable sqlite3 commands
# ask for name, type, due date of project,
  # convert into exicutible sqlite3 commands
# ask for expected length of time required to finish it (suggest adding another 3rd the time on because good idea)
  # calculate when to start project and enter it into the date_to_start column
# allow user to update the status of project finished
# when done entering info
# show what projects need started this month
# show projects that have not been completed, but the due date hasn't passed
# show what events are happening this month.

# 3 main steps
# get info from user
# put info in database
# querry database for info

# response = some_sql_query
# p response

# irb(main):006:0> Date.new(2001,2,3)
# => #<Date: 2001-02-03 ((2451944j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
# irb(main):007:0> date = _
# => #<Date: 2001-02-03 ((2451944j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
# irb(main):008:0> date.iso8601
# => "2001-02-03"
